Changes:
- simde stuff - I ended up not using simde...just ported 
  basic AVX, FMA, and PCLMUL to aarch64
- set -mcpu=native instead of -march=native for ARM processors
- tightened up some stuff using volatile to make sure 
  constant folding was disabled during critical configuration calculations
- added USER_MAKEFILE.txt
- changed ConfigLog.h to CONFIG_LOG.txt
- added a quick start guide in README
- added some -Wl,-rpath trickery to make sure we link to the right shared libs
- added pkg-config stuff
- added DESTDIR to uninstall
- added ENABLE_LIBTOOL flag
- added ENABLE_RPATH flag
- added SYS_PREFIX var

- updates to doc files: make sure to update doc/* on the web page 

- The header file ZZ_limbs.h creates an include dependency
  for <gmp.h> which otherwise doesn't exist. This creates
  an issue for packaging.

documentation:
 - ../doc/config.txt
 - ../doc/tour-unix.html

Observation:
 - I tried linking shared NTL against a static-only GMP.
 - On macOS, this worked. 
 - On Linux, no. For this, I had to build GMP with --with-pic.
   Then it worked as expected.
 - This makes me think I should provide the same option for NTL:
   have an ENABLE_PIC switch. When building a static library
   using libtool, this will pass -prefer-pic to libtool.
   Note that this needs to go after gcc, which means we need to
   sandwhich it somehow. Better idea is to have LCOMPILE do the
   everything, instead of LCOMP COMPILE, define 
   LCOMPILE = LCOMP COMPILE LCOMPT

TODO:
 - bundle SIMDE with NTL
   - why? 
     - we adapt a sepcific version, which could break in future versions
     - we use only a specific subset 
     - we can turn it on by default so that macOS users get immediate benefit
   - update DoConfig, mfile, config.txt (get rid of prefix stuff and checks)
   - update include paths
   - put directory under NTL
   - make install, package need to explicitlt copy
   - git add NTL/simde directory
   - get from here:  https://github.com/simd-everywhere/simde-no-tests
 - look at clobber, clean, and uninstall
 - take config.h out of INCL (should not go in tarball)
   DONE: but make sure it doesn't break anything
 - update ../doc/copying.txt

  

Speedups:
- Mat<ZZ_p> n=1000, k=1000, 6.05219 vs 12.8913
- Mat<zz_p> n=1000, k=20 0.0523988 vs 0.286388
 GF2X n=10000 5.71701e-06 3.97838e-05



-----------------------------
These are basically notes to myself on preparing a new
distribution of NTL.
-----------------------------

- make sure I update tour-time.html

- update ../README and ../doc/copying.txt

- change version numbers in ../include/NTL/version.h, DIRNAME, and WINDIR

- change the libtool soname in VERSION_INFO. See:

http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual/html_node/Updating-version-info.html

- if changes were made to makefile or ../include/NTL/config.h, 
  make sure these changes are implemented in the template files 
  mfile and cfile, and then run:

export COPYFILE_DISABLE=1
make ppdoc
make ppclean
make package
make winpack



=====================================

TODO: add a runtime flag that makes GetTime call GetWallTime

FIXME: maybe it would make more sense to take the +1/-1 logic
out of [cg]_lip_impl block_construct routines and just put it in
the caller: the ZZ_p and ZZVec BlockConstruct stuff: add 1 there...
that would mean in the ZZ_p ConstructFromVec we don't do the -1 either...
not critical...

FIXME: maybe add a reserve method to Vec, for compatibility
with STL vectors.


TODO list:
     * allow 32-bit SP MulMod...this would allow GPU/SSE 
       support...both this and previous would require
       a complete scan to introduce new, special types
     * add template functions clear(), to clear multiple
       entries in a Vec or Poly.  The important thing is
       to provide specialized ones for Vec<GF2> and GF2X.
