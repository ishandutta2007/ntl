Changes:
- simde stuff
- set -mcpu=native instead of -march=native for ARM processors
- tightened up some stuff using volatile to make sure 
  constant folding was disabled during critical configuration calculations
- added USER_MAKEFILE.txt
- changed ConfigLog.h to CONFIG_LOG.txt
- added a quick start guide in README
- added some -Wl,-rpath trickery to make sure we link to the right shared libs
- added pkg-config stuff
- added DESTDIR to uninstall
- added ENABLE_LIBTOOL flag
- added ENABLE_RPATH flag
- added SYS_PREFIX var

- updates to doc files: make sure to update doc/* on the web page 

- The header file ZZ_limbs.h creates an include dependency
  for <gmp.h> which otherwise doesn't exist. This creates
  an issue for packaging.

documentation:
 - ../doc/config.txt
 - ../doc/tour-unix.html

TODO:
 - look at clobber, clean, and uninstall
 - take config.h out of INCL (should not go in tarball)
   DONE: but make sure it doesn't break anything

  

Speedups:
- Mat<ZZ_p> n=1000, k=1000, 6.05219 vs 12.8913
- Mat<zz_p> n=1000, k=20 0.0523988 vs 0.286388
 GF2X n=10000 5.71701e-06 3.97838e-05



-----------------------------
These are basically notes to myself on preparing a new
distribution of NTL.
-----------------------------

- make sure I update tour-time.html

- update ../README and ../doc/copying.txt

- change version numbers in ../include/NTL/version.h, DIRNAME, and WINDIR

- change the libtool soname in VERSION_INFO. See:

http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual/html_node/Updating-version-info.html

- if changes were made to makefile or ../include/NTL/config.h, 
  make sure these changes are implemented in the template files 
  mfile and cfile, and then run:

export COPYFILE_DISABLE=1
make ppdoc
make ppclean
make package
make winpack



=====================================

TODO: add a runtime flag that makes GetTime call GetWallTime

FIXME: maybe it would make more sense to take the +1/-1 logic
out of [cg]_lip_impl block_construct routines and just put it in
the caller: the ZZ_p and ZZVec BlockConstruct stuff: add 1 there...
that would mean in the ZZ_p ConstructFromVec we don't do the -1 either...
not critical...

FIXME: maybe add a reserve method to Vec, for compatibility
with STL vectors.


TODO list:
     * allow 32-bit SP MulMod...this would allow GPU/SSE 
       support...both this and previous would require
       a complete scan to introduce new, special types
     * add template functions clear(), to clear multiple
       entries in a Vec or Poly.  The important thing is
       to provide specialized ones for Vec<GF2> and GF2X.
