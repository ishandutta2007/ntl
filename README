QUICK START GUIDE FOR UNIX
---------------------------------

In the src directory, you can use the basic pattern of 
   ./configure
   make 
   make install
However, NTL's configure script does not follow the normal autotools syntax. 
See doc/config.txt for all the options.

The most common and important options:

   GMP_PREFIX=/path/to/gmp/installation  
   - this defaults to /usr/local, but you need to change it if GMP
     is installed somewhere else
   - note that for best performannce, you may want to build GMP from source,
     rather than rely on a system installation (which is often not tuned
     to your particular machine)

   PREFIX=/path/to/ntl/installation
   - this also defaults to /usr/local, but you need to change it if you
     want to install NTL somewhere else
   
   SHARED=on
   - this defaults to "off", but you should set it to "on" if you want
     to build NTL as a shared (dynamic) library

After running the configure script, the files CONFIG_LOG.txt and
USER_MAKEFILE.txt are written to the include/NTL directory.
CONFIG_LOG.txt summarizes the configuration options used to build NTL.
USER_MAKEFILE.txt is a simple example makefie that users can use
to compile their programs using the installed library.

Before running make install, you should probably run
   make check
to make sure everything works. This can take a few minutes.
